        <h1><strong>HTML text formatting</strong></h1>
        <br>
        <p>HTML which stands for <mark> HyperText Markup Language</mark>is the standard markup language for documents designed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style sheet(CSS) and scripting languages such  as JavaScript. Web browsers recieve HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearence of the document. </p>
        <p>As an example text can be <strong>bolded</strong> ,<em>italized</em>, <sub>subscripted</sub> and <sup>superscripted</sup> using HTML.</p>
         <p> Not only that, when designing websites you may need to emphasize an <strong>important</strong> text or make a word look <small>smaller </small> than others. And you can also draw a line over <strike> text like this</strike> or <u> Underline a text.</u></p>
        <p>And if you want to use a section that is quoted from another sourse as belows</p>
        <blockquote>" HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged  the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]"   </blockquote>
